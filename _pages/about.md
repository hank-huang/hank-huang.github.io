Hi, I'm Henry and this is my personal website. I started working on it as an
exercise in learning how to build websites in Python, and over time it's
developed into a place where I share my thoughts and projects. It's also been
a great excuse for me to start writing again, which I've been meaning to do for
a while!

I'm currently a junior at [Skidmore College](https://www.skidmore.edu/) in
Saratoga Springs, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
