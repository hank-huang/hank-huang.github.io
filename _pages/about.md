Hi, I'm Henry and this is my personal website. I started working on it as an exercise in learning how to build websites in Python, and over time it's developed into a place where I share my thoughts and projects.

I'm currently a junior at [Skidmore College](https://www.skidmore.edu/) in Saratoga Springs, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
